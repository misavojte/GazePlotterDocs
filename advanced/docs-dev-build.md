# App dev & build
GazePlotterDocs uses VitePress to build and serve the documentation site from `.md` files. The development set-up requires that you have Node (14 or higher) installed.

More about the dev & build process of the main app can be found [here](./app-dev-build).

## Download the source code
The code can be downloaded as a zip file, but it is highly recommended to either fork the repository or clone it.
