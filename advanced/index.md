# Advanced GazePlotter possibilities
With GazePlotter, you can go beyond the scope of the common user. It's possible to download the source code and build your own version of the app, with own features and modifications.

You can also download GazePlotter as a PWA and run it locally on your computer. This is useful if you want to use GazePlotter without an internet connection.
