## Export Functionality

Use the **Export Metadata** button to download a comprehensive CSV file containing all metadata information. This is useful for:

## Legacy Data Support

For data processed before GazePlotter version 1.7.0, source parsing metadata may not be available, as this feature was introduced in later versions.

## Privacy & Security

All metadata is processed and stored locally in your browser. Memory usage monitoring and metadata export operate entirely client-side, ensuring complete privacy of your research data.
