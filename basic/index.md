- You'll see a demo visualization with sample data

**Step 2: Upload Your Data** 
- Click "Import workspace or data" at the top
- Select your eye-tracking data file
- GazePlotter automatically detects the file type and creates visualizations

**Step 3: Explore Your Data**
- Use the controls in each plot to switch between participants, stimuli, and time views
- Click and drag plots to move them around
- Use the workspace toolbar to add more visualizations

**Step 4: Save Your Work**
- Click "Export workspace or data" to save your analysis
- Choose "Workspace" to save everything for later or sharing with colleagues

## Main Workspace Controls

At the top of the GazePlotter workspace, you'll find these essential controls:

1. **Import workspace or data** - Upload your eye-tracking data files (automatically detects file type)
2. **Reload Demo** - Reset to the sample data if you want to start over
3. **Export workspace or data** - Save your analysis or export data for other tools

## Understanding the Interface

When you first open GazePlotter, you'll see a **scarf plot** (timeline visualization) showing sample data. This demo includes:
- **2 stimuli** (different images or screens participants looked at)
- **6 AOIs** (Areas of Interest - specific regions in the images)
- **9 participants** (people whose eye movements were recorded)
- **3 participant groups** (organized for comparison)

## Types of Visualizations

GazePlotter offers three main ways to view your eye-tracking data:

- **[Scarf Plot](/basic/scarf-plot/)** - Timeline view showing the sequence of where people looked over time
- **[Bar Plot](/basic/bar-plot/)** - Bar charts comparing how much time was spent in different areas
- **[Transition Matrix](/basic/transition-matrix/)** - Heat map showing how gaze moved between areas

## Customizing Your Analysis

You can personalize how your data appears and is organized:

- **[AOI Customization](/basic/aoi-customization/)** - Change colors, names, and order of areas of interest
- **[Stimuli Customization](/basic/stimuli-customization/)** - Rename and organize your images/screens
- **[Participant Grouping](/basic/groups/)** - Create groups to compare different types of participants
- **[Participant Customization](/basic/participants-customization/)** - Rename participants for easier identification

## What You Can Do

**Basic Operations:**
- **Upload data** from any major eye-tracking software
- **View data** in three different visualization types
- **Move and resize** plots by dragging
- **Add multiple plots** to compare different views
- **Save your work** to continue later or share with others

**Advanced Features:**
- **Customize colors and names** of areas of interest
- **Group participants** for comparative analysis
- **Export data** for use in other analysis tools
- **Create multiple workspaces** for different projects

## Export Options

For exporting data and workspaces, see the dedicated [Export section](/export/) which covers workspace export, segmented data export, and ScanGraph integration.
