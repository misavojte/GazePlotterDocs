# Scarf plot
Scarf plot (or sequential graph) is a visualization of eye movement data that shows the sequence of fixations and saccades in time. It is a useful tool for analyzing the order of fixations and saccades, and for comparing the scanpaths of different participants or stimuli. Specific areas of interest (AOIs) in the given stimuli are color-coded and displayed in the scarf plot. The scarf plot is the main visualization tool in GazePlotter, and it is used to visualize eye-tracking data from various eye-tracking software.

## Basic controls
In GazePlotter, scarf plots have following main controls:
1. **Title** - the title of the scarf plot, which can be changed by clicking on it.
2. **Stimulus selector** - a drop-down menu for selecting the stimulus to be displayed in the scarf plot.
3. **Timeline selector** - a drop-down menu for selecting the timeline type to be displayed in the scarf plot (absolute, relative, ordinal; see [Timelines](/basic/timelines.md)).
4. **Group selector** - a drop-down menu for selecting the group of participants to be displayed in the scarf plot (see [Groups](/basic/groups.md)).
5. **Zoom in/out** - buttons for zooming in and out of the scarf plot.
6. **More options** - a button for accessing additional options for the scarf plot (see [More options](#more-options)).
