# Timeline representations
In GazePlotter's scar plots, you can switch between different timeline representations just by clicking on the timeline representation button (see [Scarf plot](/basic/scarf-plot/)).

## Available timelines in scarf plots
The following timeline representations are available:
1. absolute time (in milliseconds)
2. relative time (to the duration of the dwell time of the participant with the highest dwell time)
3. ordinal time (just order indices of the individual fixations, saccades and other events like blinks)

Some data, e.g. from [OGAMA software](/upload-data/ogama.md), support only ordinal time representation.
