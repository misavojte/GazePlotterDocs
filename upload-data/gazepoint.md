# GazePoint Analysis export and upload

GazePlotter supports the upload of data from the GazePoint Analysis eye-tracking software.

In the GazePoint Analysis software, select `Analyze Data > Export > Select CSV Data`. Then click `Export CSV data` to export the data.

User data is then exported into multiple CSV format of two types, XXXX-user.csv and XXXX-user-fix.csv. To GazePlotter, only the XXXX-user.csv file is important - select all of them after clicking `Upload data` button (see [GazePlotter GUI overview](/basic/).

## Sample data

You can download the sample data, including other formats, from [OSF Sample Data Storage](https://osf.io/j58v3).
