# Getting started with GazePlotter
GazePlotter is a web application for visualizing gaze data from eye-tracking software. It uses interactive scarf plots (or sequence charts) which are built automatically from the data without any manual configuration and data transformation.

The workplace is designed to be easy to use and to provide a quick overview of the data. The workplace is available at [gazeplotter.com](https://gazeplotter.com).

## Start demo visualization

For a quick start of the GazePlotter workplace, you can hit the `Try demo data` button on the [GazePlotter app](https://gazeplotter.com). This will start a scarf chart visualization of a sample data file.

## Upload your own data
You can upload your own data files to the GazePlotter workplace. The workplace will automatically detect the file type and start a visualization of the data. The workplace supports the following file types:

- [Tobii Pro Lab](./tobii-pro-lab.md)
- [OGAMA](./ogama.md)
- [GazePoint](./gazepoint.md)
- [SMI BeGaze](./smi-begaze.md)
