# OGAMA upload
GazePlotter supports the upload of data from the [OGAMA](https://ogama.net) eye-tracking software. 

Their big limitation is that they support only ordinal type of timeline in interactive scarf plots (sequence charts). OGAMA doesn't support dynamic AOI visibility information.

## Export & upload basic data

Just do it.
