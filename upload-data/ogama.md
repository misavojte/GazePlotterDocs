# OGAMA upload
GazePlotter supports the upload of data from the [OGAMA](https://ogama.net) eye-tracking software. 

::: warning
Big limitation of OGAMA export is support only for ordinal type of timeline (see [Timelines](/basic/timelines/)) in interactive scarf plots. OGAMA doesn't support dynamic AOI visibility information.
