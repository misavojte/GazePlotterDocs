# Tobii Pro Lab upload
To upload data from Tobii Pro Lab, you need to export the data as a `.tsv` file. 

## Navigate to Metrics Export tab


The `.tsv` file can be exported from the Tobii Pro Lab software by selecting `File > Export > CSV`. The CSV file can be exported in two different formats: `Gaze data` and `Gaze data with fixations`. The `Gaze data` format is the default format and it contains the raw gaze data. The `Gaze data with fixations` format contains the raw gaze data and the fixation data. The fixation data is used to calculate the fixation duration and the fixation count. The fixation data is not used for the visualization of the data.
